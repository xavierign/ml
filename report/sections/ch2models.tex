To address this classification general problems, the receipt is to try a diverse variety of model to get some candidates. Several classification algorithms were tested from the Machine Learning Toolbox. Here are some brief comments about the result.

\textbf{Linear Models}: reusing some functions from previous homework we evaluated a Logistic Regression Model.
