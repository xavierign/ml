In the following report, we will describe the methodology we used to develop the solution presented by team \textbf{Flechazo} (arrow shot) during the in-class Kaggle competition for \textit{COMS 4721 Spring 2016}.
We developed an algorithm based on ensemble methods that enabled us to reach a prediction rate of $95.156\%$ on the public leaderboard after 13 attempts. On the private leaderboard, the prediction rate of our model was reduced to $95.023\%$, although our position in the leaderboard went up by $2$. Compared to the rest of the class, we reached the $15^{th}$ position, with a $0.4\%$ prediction rate difference compared to the winning team.\vspace{.5cm}\\
The tasks for the project were assigned in the following way: since Xavier has significant experience in Machine Learning projects, he initially ran the data preprocessing tasks that historically yielded good results to him. After agreeing upon the preprocessing, each member ran different models in their machines using the processed dataset, in order to improve processing times. Only those models which actually improved on our existing cv-rate were submitted to Kaggle, so as to keep the number of submissions as low as possible. This report is co-authored by each of the three members, by firstly agreeing on a core structure, then splitting chapter writing and finally peer-reviewing each of the assigned sections.
